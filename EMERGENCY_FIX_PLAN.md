# EMERGENCY FIX PLAN - SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS
- ❌ Azure Web App showing default page instead of Flask app
- ❌ All API endpoints returning 404 
- ❌ Flask app not starting on Azure despite configuration
- ❌ No proper error logging/debugging info

## ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION CHECKLIST

### 1. FLASK APP ISSUES
- [ ] Check Flask app syntax errors
- [ ] Fix deprecated decorators (@app.before_first_request)
- [ ] Fix OpenAI API calls (new format)
- [ ] Test Flask app locally first
- [ ] Verify all imports work
- [ ] Check requirements.txt completeness

### 2. AZURE DEPLOYMENT ISSUES  
- [ ] Verify startup command is correct
- [ ] Check if Python runtime is actually set
- [ ] Verify file structure in Azure
- [ ] Check Azure logs for deployment errors
- [ ] Ensure requirements.txt is being used
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set

### 3. GITHUB ACTIONS DEPLOYMENT
- [ ] Check if deployment is actually completing
- [ ] Verify zip file contents
- [ ] Check deployment logs
- [ ] Ensure proper file paths

### 4. DEBUGGING STRATEGY
- [ ] Create simple test Flask app to verify deployment works
- [ ] Test locally before deploying
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Create step-by-step verification

## EXECUTION PLAN

### PHASE 1: LOCAL TESTING (5 mins)
1. Test Flask app locally
2. Fix any syntax/import errors
3. Verify all endpoints work locally

### PHASE 2: AZURE DEBUGGING (10 mins)  
1. Check Azure deployment logs
2. Verify runtime and startup command
3. Test with minimal Flask app if needed
4. Force proper deployment

### PHASE 3: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING (10 mins)
1. Test all endpoints systematically
2. Verify Instagram OAuth flow
3. Test AI functionality
4. Confirm frontend integration

### PHASE 4: GITHUB COMMIT (2 mins)
1. Only commit when 90%+ tests pass
2. Document what was fixed
3. Provide working URLs

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- ✅ Flask app responds at root URL
- ✅ All API endpoints return proper responses
- ✅ Instagram OAuth generates valid URLs
- ✅ AI chat functionality works
- ✅ Database operations work
- ✅ Frontend can connect to backend
