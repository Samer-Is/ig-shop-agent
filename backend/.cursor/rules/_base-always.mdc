description: Universal style + hygiene for every AI call

# Style
- 2-space indent, single quotes, no trailing semicolons
- Strict typing (`"strict": true`, `noImplicitAny`, `mypy --strict`)
- Prefer pure functions; classes only when stateful objects are unavoidable

# Comments & Docs
- Every public function/class must include a docstring or JSDoc with:
  - Purpose
  - Parameters & types
  - One usage example

# File-size rule
- Hard limit 400 LOC per file (Cursor’s 500-line guidance minus headroom)  

# Verification checklist (AI MUST confirm before saying “done”)
1. Lint passes without `--fix`
2. No `console.log` / `print` / `TODO`
3. New code covered by tests or test stubs
4. No secrets committed
