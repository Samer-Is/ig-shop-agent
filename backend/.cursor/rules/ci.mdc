# Shell scripts
- Must start with `set -euo pipefail`
- Use `shellcheck` in CI (`-x` flag for sourced files)

# Workflow guidelines
- Require `npm ci` / `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir`
- Never publish to production branches without green tests

# Verification checklist
1. `shellcheck` passes on every script
2. CI config does **not** reference personal access tokens directly
