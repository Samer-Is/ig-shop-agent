# Test philosophy
- Each new public function => one unit test minimum.
- Tests must be deterministic; mock flaky IO & network calls.

# Python
- Use `pytest`, arrange-act-assert layout, fixtures in `conftest.py`.

# JS/TS
- Use `vitest` or `jest`; follow `describe / it / expect` pattern.

# Coverage gate
- Project-wide coverage â‰¥ 80 %; block merge if lower.

# Self-audit
- AI should suggest test skeletons when adding new code in `src/`.
