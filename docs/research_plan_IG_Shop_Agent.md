# Research Plan: IG-Shop-Agent Technical Analysis

## Objectives
- To provide a comprehensive technical analysis for the development of the IG-Shop-Agent SaaS platform.
- To detail the requirements, configurations, and best practices for integrating the Instagram/Meta API, Azure AI Search, and multi-tenant authentication.

## Research Breakdown
- **Area 1: Instagram/Meta API Integration**
  - Sub-task 1.1: Research Instagram Messaging API capabilities for DM automation.
  - Sub-task 1.2: Investigate webhook setup and requirements for real-time message handling.
  - Sub-task 1.3: Analyze authentication flows for business accounts.
  - Sub-task 1.4: Identify limitations and compliance requirements for Instagram DM automation, especially concerning Jordanian Arabic.
- **Area 2: Azure AI Search**
  - Sub-task 2.1: Research multi-tenant vector indexing strategies in Azure AI Search.
  - Sub-task 2.2: Detail the configuration and setup process for Azure AI Search.
  - Sub-task 2.3: Analyze cost and scaling considerations for Azure services.
- **Area 3: SaaS Authentication and Architecture**
  - Sub-task 3.1: Research multi-tenant authentication patterns, including the use of Ed25519 signatures.
  - Sub-task 3.2: Outline a technical architecture for real-time message processing.
  - Sub-task 3.3: Investigate integration patterns for OpenAI GPT-4o with function calling.

## Key Questions
1. What are the specific capabilities and limitations of the Instagram Messaging API for automating DMs, especially with Jordanian Arabic?
2. How can Azure AI Search be architected to support multi-tenancy for vector indexing of product catalogs?
3. What are the most secure and scalable authentication patterns for a multi-tenant SaaS application using Ed25519 signatures?
4. What are the best practices for handling real-time messaging and order management for multiple Instagram shops?
5. What are the compliance and rate-limiting factors to consider when building on the Instagram API?
6. How can Azure service costs be optimized for a growing SaaS platform?
7. What is the most effective way to integrate OpenAI's GPT-4o with function calling for this application?

## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources**: Official documentation from Meta for the Instagram API, Microsoft for Azure AI Search, and relevant open-source communities for authentication patterns.
- **Search strategies**: Use targeted keywords on `batch_web_search` to find technical articles, tutorials, and best practice guides.

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements**: Cross-reference information from at least two independent and credible sources.
- **Cross-validation**: Compare official documentation with community-driven best practices and tutorials.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive technical analysis document in Markdown format, covering all the specified focus areas.
- The document will include technical specifications, implementation guidance, and cost considerations.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus**: Search
- **Justification**: This task requires gathering and synthesizing a large amount of technical information from various sources. A search-focused workflow is the most efficient way to collect the necessary data before proceeding with analysis and documentation.
